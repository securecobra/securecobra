- 👋 Hi, I’m @securecobra
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, generally obsessed with technology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science in university, meanwhile persuing personal quests separately
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, i don't find myself eligible to do projects. But i strongly believe in learning through practice, so i'm down to collaborate in any beginner friendly projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on my e-mail: fatitar206@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: apart from my tech-obsession i really enjoy poetry and reading
